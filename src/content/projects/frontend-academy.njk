title: Frontend Academy

shortname: frontend-academy

summary: I served “professor realness” to bolster the foundational frontend concepts of our engineering team. The courses I put together on modern HTML, CSS, and accessibility led to measured improvement and higher quality code commits.

  <p>{{ leadIn("At the start of 2020,") }} I was asked to see how much work it’d be to update our app’s visual style to match our parent company’s emerging design system. As a designer that knows his way around a frontend challenge, I agreed to evaluate how feasible it would be to get that update out the door.</p>

  <p>When I took a closer look at the markup and styles in our frontend codebase, I found deprecated features and discouraged practices&thinsp;—&thinsp;things like inline styles, unneeded CSS prefixes, and high selector specificities. Now, to be fair, tech debt like this is likely to be in a lot of longstanding SaaS apps, but I also found these discouraged practices pop up in new features, too. It got me thinking about the best way to help the team’s understanding of modern frontend styles and how to go about building them in our code. Could I carve out time in our team’s busy schedule to set a good foundation of modern HTML, CSS, and accessibility practices?</p>

  <p>{{ leadIn("After digging around in") }} our code, I decided that a lecture series would be the best way to deliver modern best practices in a concise package. I paired up with an engineer, and we set out to create an optimal curriculum for our team. We took a long list of topics and whittled it down to a list of ten topics on <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/">both sides of the great frontend divide</a>. Of those ten topics, I put together and delivered slides for these eight:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>CSS Cascade, Specificity, and the Box Model</li>
    <li>Testing Your Work with Dev Tools</li>
    <li>Testing on Internet Explorer 11 (yeahhh I know)</li>
    <li>Modern CSS, Layouts, and Markup</li>
    <li>Responsive Design</li>
    <li>Inclusive Design and Markup</li>
    <li>Internationalization</li>
    <li>SCSS</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Each topic was expanded upon in a weekly, hour-long lecture. For each lecture’s presentation, I cited high-quality sources like the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Docs</a>, <a href="https://css-tricks.com">CSS-Tricks</a>, and <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a> (just to name a few). I started with broad explanations, and then dove deep with example code, custom diagrams, and a few CodePens to help give devs different ways to grapple course material.</p>

  <p>After each session, a recording of the course, the slides, and the additional examples were uploaded for engineers to refer to later on.</p>

  <p>Overall, we made good progress on everyone’s understanding of frontend coding. When we compared our progress with a before-and-after quiz, we saw a marked improvement of several percentage points. Not bad for a ten-week crash course!</p>
