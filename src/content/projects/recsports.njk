    <h2>Motivation</h2>
  </div>

  <p>The University of Michiganâ€™s Recreational Sports department is a multifaceted group that operates workout facilities, holds exercise classes, and plans individualized programs for students and faculty. In other words: this group does a lot. Unfortunately, the groupâ€™s old site did them a disservice since all the information describing these programs and benefits was disorganized and unclear. What was clear: Rec Sports was ready for a new, easy-to-maintain site.</p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section__contents">
    <p>I started out this project by corralling the key stakeholders to discuss goals of the site, priorities that each subgroup of the Rec Sports, and possible directions. We also created key personas (following my <a href="">design process</a>) at that initial meeting so that the proposed design and content would stay focused. As our design meetings continued, I also tested my plans with real users to validate them.</p>

    {{ aside("https://johnmatu.la/wp-content/uploads/template_herolandscape-recsports.jpg", "blahh", "A good example of this was a custom Google Calendar module that displays the schedule for group exercise classes, with rationale for spending time on it.") }}
    <p>For this project, I was both the lead UX designer and the lead frontend developer, so I constantly evaluated the feasibility and value of design decisions. A good example of this was a custom Google Calendar module that displays the schedule for group exercise classes. Though proposing this feature would mean custom development work for the dev team, the high priority and significant value it had provided the rationale for spending time on it. In a similar fashion, thatâ€™s how I prioritized modular components, zero-tap facility info, and an entirely-custom WordPress editor interface in the redesigned site, too.</p>


    <p>My biggest design decision on the site was a single page format. Each major program of Rec Sports got one single page containing all necessary content. I supported that with a navigation system so that someone could jump to a specific piece of content via the menu or a URL. Though it was tricky to get this working with WordPress, this balance was the sweet spot between total visibility and a simple, speedy experience.</p>

    <p>After launch, I kept evaluating the success of the site (in fact, that helped us make a key terminology change early on). We also tracked membership signups as a key success metric, and we saw a 19-percent increase immediately following the launch of the site.</p>

    <p>Maybe thatâ€™s why, months later, I found my design replicated on the University of Virginiaâ€™s Rec Sports siteâ€¦ ðŸ˜‰</p>

  <ul class="retrospective">
    <li>Bad: The site is not built on a frontend framework, unfortunately. With features that make it feel more like an app (especially the custom schedule plugin), using a framework could open up the site to even richer experiences with less developer frustration.</li>
    <li>Bad: By acting as both the UX designer and the lead developer for the project, some of my design decisions were affected by my limitations in frontend and backend development.</li>
    <li>Good: The flat, single-page navigation makes it easy to find information, while the hooks into Wordpressâ€™s menu system makes it easy to jump right to specific content.</li>
    <li>Good: Creating a custom system powered by Google Calendar taught me tons about APIs and data handling. (And PHP.)</li>
    <li>Good: In providing a rich customization layer to the WordPress editor view, I was able to ensure that the site would be maintainable and easily adaptable for years.</li>
