  <p>About a year into my time as Senior Product Designer at CrowdTwist, my team had some good processes in place to ensure that new features were vetted and understood by users. These feedback sessions were working well for new additions to our platform, but I noticed that we lacked a way to review existing features. We needed to evaluate the current state of things, especially legacy parts of the platform that weren’t thoroughly tested with users.</p>

  <p>I put together a plan that helped us fill this gap: 13 feedback sessions that would manage to cover the entire platform. Each meeting was an hour long and was open to the entire organization, including Engineering, Client Success, Marketing, and Sales. The sessions were purposefully broad so that my resource-constrained team—that is, my team of two—could tackle the most pressing issues while saving deeper investigations for later.</p>

  <p>Each session had two major parts: a discussion and a participatory design exercise. We started with an open forum of the benefits and drawbacks of that particular session’s topic. In these dialogues, we made sure to seek out a balance of opinions, avoiding sole reliance on the most vocal participant. These casual discussions helped warm everyone up for the hands-on exercise, which was something like card sorting, sketching, or storyboarding.</p>

  <p>So what were we left with? Thanks to good participation from the company, we had plenty discussion feedback to sift through, design exercise results to decipher, and new questions to dig into later. We ended up summarizing the discussion points and pertinent data from the design exercises after each session while it was fresh.</p>

  <p>Then, after all of the sessions, we created a prioritized plan of what areas needed UX attention first. We plotted features based on estimated technical complexity and design complexity onto a chart. Whatever was in the lower-left quadrant (low tech effort and design effort) formed the list of areas that were highest priority to address first. Combined with our list of topics to investigate further, we had a sound path forward to improve the CrowdTwist platform.</p>

  <p>Overall, I was really pleased with how this project turned out. It certainly helped that the company was as engaged and willing to help out as they were—not to mention an excellent team member to help collect and analyze feedback in each of our sessions. So, as a way to share our plan and give gratitude to everyone, we hosted a UX-themed happy hour.</p>

  <ul class="retrospective">
  <li class="retrospective--good">Good: We collected feedback that had never been recorded at CrowdTwist.</li>
  <li class="retrospective--good">Good: The sessions improved visibility of our team and helped validate our long-term goals.</li>
  <li class="retrospective--bad">Bad: Large format of sessions meant that less-vocal colleagues could be unwilling to speak up, even when encouraged to do so. In the future, we could vary feedback size and format to better support everyone’s preferences.</li>
