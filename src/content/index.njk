{% block introduction %}
Hello!<br>I’m John Matula, a designer and frontend developer.
{% endblock %}


{% block about %}
<p>I’ve been interested in design and tech as long as I can remember. So, a lot of my hobbies sound like work (they aren’t, I swear!), like reading about the newest <a href="https://underconsideration.com/brandnew/">brand redesign</a> or playing around with typography and photography on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/matulaspatula/">my Instagram</a>.</p>

<p>Beyond that, you’ll also find me taking care of too many plants and passing quarantine with a sudoku or Jumble. And I can’t forget some of my favorite acronyms, like <a href="http://www.vh1.com/shows/rupauls-drag-race">RPDR</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org">NPR</a>, and <a href="https://www.themcelroy.family/mbmbam">MBMBaM</a>.</p>

<p>Professionally, I’ve been in some sort of UX design, graphic design, or frontend development role since 2012. I really enjoy seeing a project from all sides: its frontend and backend feasibility, its aesthetic quality, its business value.</p>

<p>I’m currently a Principal UX Designer at Oracle CrowdTwist. I work on the UX of our loyalty engine platform, and I also use our platform to create custom websites for several brands’ rewards programs.</p>
