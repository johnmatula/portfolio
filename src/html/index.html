<h1 class="pagetitle">My Great Page</h1>
<p class="summary">This total redesign unified a university organization, paved the way for 20% growth in memberships, and even inspired some other universities to borrow my designs.</p>
<h2 class="header">Process</h2>
<p class="paragraph">Intro paragraph. This would have only a minor amount of introduction, mostly to go over the high level process. If there needed to be more detail, we could use a header to further break up this section.</p>
<h3 class="subheader">Inspiring Other Sites</h3>
<p class="paragraph--beforeimage">This paragraph could go into further detail about parts of the process. Ideally, I would like to cut down on the copy in general so that it is a little easier to get through. That would make me very happy yay.</p>
<aside class="copyimage">

<p class="paragraph">If there are useful figures to bring up in amongst the process section, that’s fine! At wider browser widths, they can be treated as asides and (maybe???) floated within the confines of the grid. I’m not sure if that is even a possibility, hence me playing around here.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Hopefully this is enough placeholder content to make this tester page useful enough. Otherwise, I might have to resort to good old lorem ipsum text.</p>
